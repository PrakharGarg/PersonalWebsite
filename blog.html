										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week I moved back to Austin from my home in 
													Dallas and prepared for my final semester of college. 
													After attending both lectures of Software Engineering
													(SWE), I started to freshen up on Python and JavaScript.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													The biggest thing currently in my way is that I do not
													know how to prepare for Software Engineering. Other
													than reading the material listed on Professor Downing's
													website, I am not sure what else to do. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
													Next week I plan on beginning the first project and 
													refreshing my knowledge of Python. I also plan on
													actually preparing for the quizzes, instead of simply skimming
													over the material like I did for the first quiz. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													My initial experience of the class is that I am wary 
													of letting the work pile up. Having taken another
													project-intensive course (iOS Mobile Computing) I know
													that if I do not keep up with the work, this class can
													very easily cause a lot of stress. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week would be: <a href="https://hackdesign.org/lessons">HackDesign's website.</a>
													If you are like me and are terrible at front-end development,
													sign-up for their mailing-list and they will send you
													1 lesson a week to complete. <br /><br />
													I would also recommend <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">looking at Virtualenv</a> 
													for local Python development.

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week I started setting up for Project 1, and 
													became familar with the Professor Downing's workflow.
												  Also, I had thought the assigned readings
													were for the entire week, but after missing a few questions
													on Monday's quiz, I realized I need to complete the readings
													before the start of the week. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													The biggest thing currently in my way is that I ran into
													a lot of issues during setting up my dev enviornment. 
													First, I tried to complete the assignment locally, but after 
													running into issues with python3.5 and dependencies, I tried
													using Docker. Unfortunately, Docker didn't seem to work for 
													me either, and so now I am simply SSH'ing into the 
													lab machines. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
													Next week I plan on finishing the Collatz project, and
													also find a partner for the next project. Also, I am hoping
													that the setup for Project 2 will take a lot less time
													now that I've become familiar with the workflow.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													My experience of the class so far is that the work is
													very managable, but time-intensive. I haven't felt 
													stressed or overwhelmed in the class from the amount
													of work assigned.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week would be: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/sMwqbv3NxjK0VtpG2">Freetail Hacker's organizer application.</a>
													If you want to become involved in the hackathon world and help put on HackTX, you should definitely apply!

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week I finished the Collatz project early in the week, so
													I would have plenty of time later to make sure I completed all of the steps
													in the workflow. Finishing the project early, also made my week pretty laid back. I also 
													started preparing a lot more for the daily quizzes and have been doing a lot better on them.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													The biggest thing currently is trying to keep focused on school. 
													This is my last semester and I have already signed on with a company 
													for full-time, thus I am eager to graduate. Also, I need to find a better
													way to ingest all of the readings and actually understand and remember all of the
													material, instead of simply skimming over it and forgetting the majority of the 
													content. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
													Next week I plan on beginning the second project. I had a lot of 
													success by starting early on the first project, and hopefully I can 
													do the same for this upcoming one. I also want to get more familiar 
													with Python and flask, because I heard that later on projects rely heavily
													on flask.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													My experience of the class so far is that I really enjoy
													the style of Professor Downing's class. I like that the class
													is not just a lecture, but more of a back and forth with the students. 
													I feel more engaged in this class than my other classes, and also feel like 
													I retain the information covered in class a lot better.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is a <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/useful-atom-packages/">list of extremely useful atom packages.</a>
													I know a lot of people don't like atom because it is a web browser and can get slow at times, but I personally feel that atom
													has a lot stronger open source community behind it than sublime. Also, since the text-editor is a web browser, it has a lot 
													of support for web development.

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week I started the Netflix project and spent a lot of time
													reading up on the Netflix problem. After the collatz project, I feel
													a lot more comfortable with the workflow of the projects, and setting up
													the project took considerably less time this time around.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													There is currently nothing in my way other than my own 
													motivation. Forcing myself to complete all of the readings 
													has been rough, especially because the extreme programming book
													is extremely dry. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
												Next week I plan on finishing the Netflix project. 
												So far, I have finished Netflix.py and have gotten my 
												RMS down to .97. All I need to do now is to figure 
												out how to test my program and write the unit tests. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													My experience of the class so far is that the class is a lot
													"easier" than I imagined. Maybe it's just that the first two projects
													were more conceptual than programming based, but both collatz and netflix
													took a lot less effort than I imagined. In all honesty, the workflow
													outlined makes up for 80% of the work and the actual project is 
													actually quite trivial.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is <a href="http://documentaryheaven.com/objectified/">the objectified documentary.</a>
													If you are interested in design, Objectified is a really good documentary on all things design. The documentary 
													really makes you look a common day items that we take for granted differently, and think about how each of them
													were designed to fulfill a specific function. Apple's Jon Ive even makes an appearance and talks about the design
													of their iPod and MacBooks.

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week I finished the Netflix project. I ran into
													some problems trying to get my RMS less than 1, but after
													doing some research and looking deeper into the shared caches, 
													I finally cracked the RMS down to .97.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													The biggest thing in my way are is still the weekly
													readings. I keep telling myself that I will do better
													each weekend, but every weekend I can never bring
													myself to actually get through the readings. This is also
													partly due to the fact that each week the readings aren't
													related to last weeks. I wish there was an over-arching
													theme for the readings or something that tied them
													to each other.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
												Next week I plan on starting to study for the upcoming test.
												I have no idea what Professor Downing's tests are like, but
												I have heard that they are insanely hard. Thus, I am a little
												nervous about the test.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													My experience of the class so far is that I really enjoy the class,
													but I am not a fan of the daily quizzes. Recently I feel like
													the quizzes have gotten a lot harder, especially for the short
													amount of time allotted. Lastly, I am interested in seeing
													what the tests in this class are like. I really hope they
													are not like the quizzes.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen IO.</a>
													CodePen is a great website to test out front-end design. The
													website allows you to write html, css, and javascript and see
													the results in real-time. The website also allows you to browse
													other people's work and import their projects into your own.

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week was an incredibly calm and relaxing one. After weeks
													of having either a Software Engineering project to work on or
													a Data Management project, or even both in the same week,
													I finally had a week with nothing going on. I used this break
													to start preparing for this upcoming week, especially for the
													upcoming test in this class.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
												Currently, there is nothing in my way for this class. Some weeks
												can be stressful when we have an ongoing project in this class
												and I also have one in Data Management, but with a little bit
												of better time management, I think the rest of the semester
												should go smoothly. A big concern of mine right now is the upcoming
												test. Not having taken a Downing class before, I have no idea
												what to expect this test to be like. Also, since there is
												a lot of material to cover, I know that I will start becoming
												extremely anxious as the week goes on. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
												Next week I plan on starting to study for the upcoming test.
												I have already made a "study plan" for this week, and hopefully
												it will be enough!
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													So far, I am enjoying the class. I like all of the discussions that we have
													in class, and that the class is not simply Professor Downing
													lecturing to us for the full 45 minutes. I also really
													enjoy the short breaks during the lecture for us to implement 
													something in groups. I feel like those exercises have really
													helped my understanding on the concepts.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>
													I know it's a bit late into the semester for this, but if you still haven't gotten
													the hang of Python I highly reccommend doing a quick run through of all of the lessons.
													It's a great way to learn Python and a great resource for a quick refresher.

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week I spent a lot of time studying for the exam. 
													Not knowing anything about Downing's tests, I was extremely 
													nervous about the test going in. However, it all paid off! After
													the test was over, it was nice having nothing to do for this class
													and also having Friday off. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
												Currently, learning Flask is the biggest thing in my way. 
												As a Ruby on Rails developer, I am extremely unfamiliar 
												with unstructured web development and frameworks
												that don't provide as much as Rails does. There are also
												other APIs and frameworks I need to figure out for the 
												project.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
												Next week I plan on starting the project with my group. 
												We have a small picture of what we want to do, and getting
												started before Spring Break will really help us to finish
												this project on time without having to do a lot during the
												break.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													So far, I am enjoying the class. I was caught off by the test
													being multiple choice, and I also felt like some of the
													questions on the test were too dependent on remembering 
													one random line from the readings or class exercises. I feel
													like if you didn't make a note of something on your cheat sheet
													or specifically review a class exercise, there was no way
													that you'd be able to answer the question. I feel like the test
													should have been way more application based, rather than like the quizzes. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-crud-web-app-with-python-and-flask-part-one">a Flask Tutorial.</a>
													With everyone starting their projects this week, this is a good Flask/SQL tutorial to help
													everyone get started.

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week was one of my least intensive weeks. After the 
													exam that happened last week, this week was extremely laid 
													back. I used this time to learn flask and react and get
													ready for the IMDB project. I also went to the Google
													talk, but I thought it was a large waste of time as 
													it was more of a marketing pitch than actually showing 
													us how to use their app.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
												Currently, figuring out the best way to structure our app
												is the biggest thing in our way. With Ruby on Rails, 
												the framework dictates what your app's directory must look like,
												but with Flask there is no guidance other than a few folders.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
												Next week I plan on doing my portion of the project. I have
												decided to tackle the front-end of the project, so hopefully
												I can make a "beautiful" splash page and front-end design.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													So far, I am enjoying the class. I like the direction
													the class is taking after the test with less emphasis
													being placed on gotcha style questions and more emphasis
													on understanding the intricate parts of python. I also feel 
													like the class has gotten a lot more laid back, but in a good way. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is <a href="http://buildwithreact.com">a React Tutorial.</a>
													With everyone starting their projects this week, this is a good React tutorial to help
													everyone get started. Of all of the React tutorials out there, I thought this was the most
													interactive and helpful for someone who has never done DOM manipulation or front-end work.

												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													Coming back from spring break was rough. As a senior eager to graduate, spring break 
													really made me lose focus and what little motivation I had left. Despite some major
													senioritis, however, my group and I successfully completed Phase 1 of the IDB project. While we ran
													into a small hiccup with one of the project requirements being unclear, I am extremely proud
													of all of the work that everyone put in. Other than working on the project, I had a pretty light week
													in terms of school work. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													With only a month left of school, finding a reason to really care
													about my classes has been hard. While I haven't hit the point of
													outright forgoing my two classes, I am extremely content with simply
													riding out the last month with minimum effort. After today (Sunday), 
													we only have 6 weeks left of class. I also have no finals, so May 6th is 
													a day that I am really looking forward to.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
													Next week I plan on beginning Phase 2 of the project. I was 
													a little uncomfortable with how last minute we completed Phase 1,
													so I would definitely like to start early this time. My other class,
													Data Management, is also starting a final project so I will have to 
													start working on that as well. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													I was really disappointed by the project specs given to us for Phase 1. 
													After being forced to read so many articles on Agile, Extreme Programming, and
													general best practices for managing development, receiving a pretty vague and not updated
													requirement doc for Phase 1 was frustrating. There were a lot of Piazza posts that had to be made
													that could have easily been resolved with a clearer spec sheet. Also, there were many components
													of this phase that seemed like a waste of time and could have easily been moved to the next phase where it would
													be more practical. Both Model.py and Tests.py did not really need to be in this phase: both could not be run/tested so we had no way to know if what we did was right.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=hackathon%20hackers">the Hackathon Hackers fb group</a>
													It's a community of people around the world who are interested in hackathon, building cool things, and tech in general. I always see 
													really active discussions about important topics, and the community also has a lot of resources if you are trying to learn something new.

											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week was a pretty big slump for me. I barely got any
													work done in either of my classes. I just had no motivation whats-so-ever.
													I did manage however to get most of the front-end done for Phase 2 for our 
													group project, so I guess there's that.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													With the deadline for Phase 2 coming up, getting everyone to 
													finish their piece on time will be a struggle. Already, a lot of work
													is still untouched, and as students its hard to get on people to do their work.
													I think that is the biggest obstacle I have run into with this project. Even though
													we have "team leaders" for phases, its still a bit akward to tell someone to get their work
													done faster since there is no actual hierarchy in leadership.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
													Next week I plan on finishing Phase 2 and also start slowly collecting assets for the test
													at the end of the semester. Last time, I had a horrible time cramming for the test, so this time
													I would like to start earlier and do less work incrementally. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													Since I am in Data Management, going over SQL was a bit weird. I would learn something in Software Engineering and then learn it in more depth and differently in Data 
													Management. I also really enjoyed the Atlassian talk. I thought it was by far the best talk
													that we have had so far. It was the most practical and oriented towards professional development.

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week was a pretty rough. We greatly underestimated 
													how much time Phase 2 would take so we started Phase 2 pretty late.
													Thus, we spent several hours each day trying to finish the phase. We got a lot done, 
													but we still had to submit Phase 2 incomplete. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													Grossly underestimating how much time Phase 2 would take and
													the fact that none of us knew a front-end framework, Phase 2 
													was a big learning experience. Since no one in our group knew React or Angular,
													we had no idea how big of a change using these frameworks would require. 
													We mistakenly  thought we could just sprinkle in React for the sorting of our grids, and did not 
													know that we would have to restructure everything in able to use React.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
													Next week I plan on finishing the parts of Phase 2 that we did not complete and also starting Phase 3.
													I think we learned our lesson about starting late, so hopefully Phase 3 is different!
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													I feel like the class changed a lot after the test. In a sense, 
													the class has become a lot more relaxed and less intense. However,
													that stress has been transferred to after-class with the big projects. 
													While I appreciate going over SQL, I hope we will also cover more modern technologies (like small samples)
													like MongoDB (its pros and cons), Distributive Computing, and AI.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/python-book-bundle">Humble Bundle's Python Book Sale.</a>
													Humble Bundle is an awesome site that regularly has bundles for charity. In addition to buying some amazing Python books for cheap,
													the money goes straight back to Python Development!

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week was pretty chill. With nothing going on in SWE and only a minor
													project due in Data Management, I had a lot of down time this week. However, we did start working
													on Phase 3, and implemented a lot of the stuff that we were missing in Phase 2.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													ONLY 3 WEEKS LEFT. At this point, I am counting down the days to graduation and they 
													cannot come fast enough. Also, figuring out how to do some of the components for Phase 3
													are taking a lot of time in figuring out how to implement them. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
													Next week I plan on finishing Phase 3; I am looking forward to this project
													finally being done and not having to constantly work on it anymore. I also need to start
													getting ready for the final test in this class. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													What more can I say in Week 12 that I haven't already said? This class has its ups and downs (my quiz grades mostly).
													I really enjoy Downing's teaching style and how much he cares about the class. Being in another CS class that is being
													run terribly (we haven't gotten any grades back for over 2 months now, and the assignments have little structure), it really makes
													me appreciate how great Downing's class is.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is <a href="eventleaf.com/UTCSSeniorSendoff">Project Giving Tree's Senior Party!.</a>
													PGT is holding a Senior Sendoff Party this Wednesday for the Class of 2017! Come enjoy free food and celebrate the end of the year!

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week was super busy. With Phase 3 due on Thursday, we pulled
													several all-day coding sessions to make sure we wrapped up the project on time. 
													Since we had a few features missing from Phase 2, we really had our 
													work cut out for us. However, it felt really good wrapping up 
													this project and it is a huge relief to no longer have to worry 
													about this project.  
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													ONLY 2 WEEKS LEFT. With the project out of the way, everything 
													should be smooth sailing from here on out. If Test 2 is similar to Test 1,
													studying for Test 2 should be a lot easier since I know what to expect. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
													Next week I plan on working on the project presentation and also 
													starting to study for Test 2. I also need to wrap up my final 
													project in my other class. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													There is literally nothing left to say about this class. I have learned 
													a ton from this class and I am extremely glad I took this class before
													graduating. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is <a href="http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6486-transition-school-to-work.html">an article with some tips for transitioning into a full-time role after college.</a>
													Most of us have only ever worked in and internship environment that have large safety nets so that the interns can't fail too hard. After being in school for the last 
													16 years, entering the adult world is a big step and there are a lot of things that we, as students, did not have to worry about.

										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong>
												<p>
													This past week was pretty relaxed. With Phase 3 over, SWE is basically over. I SHOULD have
													started preparing for the final test in this class, but The Great British Baking Show has
													stolen all of my time. Fortunately, the hard part of SWE finished last week since I have my final 
													project in Data Management due tomorrow and that has taken a lot of my time this week. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's in your way?</strong>
												<p>
													ONLY 4 DAYS LEFT! Luckily, I don't need to even take the final
													to pass this class so that's been a major stress reducer. However,
													I don't want to end my college career on a low note, so I still plan
													on studying a fair amount for the test to keep my A. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What will you do next week?</strong>
												<p>
													Next week I plan on cramming for the test in this class and also celebrating
													graduation. With no finals this semester, my college career literally ends
													as soon as I finish the SWE test Thursday night. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my experience of the class?</strong>
												<p>
													There is literally nothing left to say about this class. I am extremely
													glad I took this class before graduating, and I hope more teachers emulate
													Downing. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong>
												<p>
													My pick of the week is <a href="https://hornraiser.utexas.edu/project/5436?utm_source=scalefunder&utm_campaign=site_share&utm_medium=facebook">a movement on campus powered by the Longhorn Entrepreneurship Agency 
														to fund a Co-Working Space on campus.</a> Unlike Capital Factory, this space is dedicated to students and will have several resources
														centered around student entrepreneurs. They have already been granted space by UT (next to Duren Dormitory) and are now working on furnishing the space,
														Make sure to keep an eye out for developments!

												<strong>Overall Empression of Software Engineering</strong>
												<p>
													I am really glad that I took SWE before graduating. Even though
													I have been doing Ruby on Rails Web Development for two years now, 
													I got a lot out of his class and learned a lot about formal
													web development in a professional sense. I really hope the rest of the CS 
													professors learn from Downing and emulate his successful class. Also, I 
													really appreciate that Downing kept his class really organized, and 
													had an amazing set of TAs. For anyone on the edge of taking this class, 
													I cannot recommend it enough.
